# BreastCancerClassification-ANN



## üìù Overview

Classifys whether the patient have Breast Cancer or not using Aritificial Neural Networks based on following features.
  
    Sample_code_number  Clump_Thickness  Uniformity_ Cell Size  Uniformity_Cell Shape   Marginal Adhesion 	Bland_Chromatin  Normal_Nucleoli 
 	 
    
## üß∞ Technical Aspects

- Data Cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature Engineering.
- Data Visualization.
- Training using Sequential Model with Dense Layers having "relu" activation as its a classification problem so "Sigmoid" function is used in last layer.
- Compiled using AdamOptmizer as optmizer and BinaryCrossEntropy as the loss function.
- Solving Overfitting issues using EarlyStoppings Callbacks and Dropout Layers in Network.
- Hyperparameter Tuning the Algorithms yielding best results.
- Testing the model on custom reallife data.
